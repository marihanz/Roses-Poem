Roses

In a garden, roses bloom,
Their petals carry tales of gloom.
In their beauty, pain resides,
Thorns of love hidden deep inside.

Their colors bright, like passion's fire,
But beneath the surface, pain's desire.
With gentle touch, their beauty is admired,
Yet be cautious, pain's inspired.

Love is a journey, a path untold,
With roses, a story begins to unfold.
Their fragrance sweet, a bittersweet spell,
Love's joys and sorrows they foretell.
