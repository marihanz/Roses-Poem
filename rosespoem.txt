Roses

In a garden, roses bloom,
Their petals carry tales of gloom.
In their beauty, pain resides,
Thorns of love, secrets it hides.

Their vibrant colors, like passion's fire,
But beneath the surface, pain's desire.
With gentle touch, their beauty is admired,
Yet be cautious, pain's inspired.

Love is a journey, a tale yet unknown,
With roses as seeds, stories are sown.
Their fragrance sweet, a bittersweet spell,
Love's joys and sorrows they foretell.
