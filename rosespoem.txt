Happy Roses

In a garden, roses bloom,
Their petals carry tales of gloom.
Yet within their beauty, happiness thrives,
Love's gentle touch, joy it derives.

Their vibrant colors, like the sun's fire,
But beneath the surface, hopeful desire.
With gentle touch, their beauty is admired,
Not need to be cautious, love's inspired.

Love is a journey, a tale yet unknown,
With roses as seeds, happiness is sown.
Their fragrance sweet, a blissful embrace,
Love's essence and delight they trace.
